Description: LAMBDA (Latent Allocation Model with Bayesian Data Analysis), for 
    simultaneous identification of unknown cell populations and discovery of 
    associations between these populations and clinical information. LAMBDA
    uses specified probabilistic models designed for modeling the different 
    distribution information for flow or mass cytometry data, respectively. 
    Moreover, LAMBDA uses a zero-inflated distribution for the mass cytometry.
